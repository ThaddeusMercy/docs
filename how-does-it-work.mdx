# How Hindsight Works  
  
Hindsight VIP turns raw blockchain data into clear visuals. It lets you explore transactions, wallets and smart contracts without reading code.  
  
## Visual Explorer  
  
- Addresses are represented by shapes. Rings show standard wallets and other shapes differentiate contracts and exchanges.  
- Colors highlight safety levels, making scams and malicious actors easy to spot.  
- Arrows and flows show how funds move from one address to another.  
  
## Using Hindsight  
  
- Search for a wallet, contract or token to view its activity.  
- Zoom in on specific transactions and follow the flow of assets.  
- Dive into smart contracts with guided visual steps that explain each function call.  
- Filter the display to focus on the data that matters to you.  
  
## Data and networks  
  
- Supports Ethereum, Solana, XRPL and Arbitrum today with more networks planned.  
- Real-time data means you see updates as they happen.  
- Machine learning will soon sort smart contracts automatically to improve clarity.
