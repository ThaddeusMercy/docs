# How Does Hindsight Work?

### Search for an address

1. Paste any address you want to search for, whether its a token, nft or wallet address, it will automatically select to the network

2. Explore the Hindsight view of the searched address

- Each shape represents the type of address
- Rings show standard wallets, squares for smart contracts or apps, and triangles for exchanges. The size of a shape can reflect how active that wallet or contract is
- Colors signal the safety level. Green means trusted or verified activity, orange shows caution, and red warns of high‑risk or scam‑like behavior
- Lines and arrows show how funds move from one address to another. The direction of the arrow shows who is sending and who is receiving. If the line appears thicker, that can indicate multiple transactions between those two points.
- Multi‑chain view means you see all of this across networks in one place. Instead of opening different explorers for each chain, you see one map that updates in real time.

## Using Hindsight

- Search for a wallet, contract or token to view its activity.
- Zoom in on specific transactions and follow the flow of assets.
- Dive into smart contracts with guided visual steps that explain each function call.
- Filter the display to focus on the data that matters to you.

## Data and networks

- Supports Ethereum, Solana, XRPL and Arbitrum today with more networks planned.
- Real-time data means you see updates as they happen.
- Machine learning will soon sort smart contracts automatically to improve clarity.
