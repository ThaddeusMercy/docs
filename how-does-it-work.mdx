# How Hindsight Works

Hindsight uses modular components to build blockchain simulations.

## Steps
- Choose a template or start from scratch
- Drag components onto the canvas
- Connect components to simulate interactions
- Run the simulation and observe results

## Behind the scenes
- Events are recorded in real time
- The engine calculates state changes
- Data is stored for analysis
