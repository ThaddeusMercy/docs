## The Big Idea: One Map, Many Chains
Blockchains are open books. But reading them is hard—especially when money and messages jump across networks.
Multi-chain analytics gives you one view of what’s happening on many chains at once. Instead of five tabs and four explorers, you get one clear map.

## What Sets Hindsight Apart
### Clear Visual Intelligence 
Hindsight turns raw onchain data into clean shapes, colors, and flows. You see how wallets, contracts, and transactions connect in a way that feels simple and direct. Complex behavior becomes easy to understand.n tools.  

### The Samaritan Network
A community driven reporting system that helps surface suspicious wallets, risky contracts, and dangerous activity. Reports are reviewed and scored, turning the community into an active security layer.

### Live Data Across Multiple Networks 
Hindsight runs on fast, reliable indexers. You get instant views of activity across Ethereum, Solana, XRPL, Arbitrum, and more. Data updates in real time so your analysis stays accurate.

### Built for Scale 
The system uses a modular pipeline. This makes it easy to add new chains, new data layers, and new visualization modes without breaking the experience.
