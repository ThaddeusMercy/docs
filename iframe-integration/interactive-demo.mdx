# Hindsight iFrame Integration

### What the demo shows

This demo loads the **USDC token page** inside the iFrame. It shows how any token or product can be embedded into your site with the same pattern. You only change the chain and the token address.

<iframe src="https://hindsight.vip/eth/token/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?embed=true" allow="clipboard-write" referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" title="USDC Token Visualization" width="100%" height="600" style={{ border:"none",minHeight:"400px" }} />

## What you see on the screen

- The token name and current date
- The network selector
- Two tabs, Transactions and Ecosystem
- The onchain graph with wallets, edges, and supply flow
- Holders and reserved supply
- Market insights and supported exchanges
- Wallets that support the token

### How it works

- The iFrame loads the full token visualization for **USDC**
- You can swap to any chain
- You can paste any token address
- You can embed the same view in dashboards,
- 

### Why this matters

One integration gives your users:

- Real time token activity
- Holder patterns
- Transaction clusters
- Market information
- Cross chain insights

If you want, I can rewrite the full intro paragraph above the iFrame to match this flow.
