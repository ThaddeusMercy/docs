# Hindsight's Visualization Approach  
![Visualization article header]({{file:815443621502935}})  
Hindsight reimagines blockchain data as simple shapes and colors so anyone can explore onchain activity. The visual explorer makes it easy to follow funds and understand smart contracts without reading code.  
## How it works  
- Wallets are shown as rings and other shapes show contracts, exchanges or tokens.  
- Colors flag safety and category so you can spot scams, stablecoins or NFTs at a glance.  
- Arrows show the flow of value between addresses so you can trace transactions.  
- You can zoom in, zoom out and filter the view to focus on what matters.  
- Step by step guides let you interact with smart contracts and see the results visually.  
## Accessible for everyone  
- The interface avoids jargon and uses clear visual language for all skill levels.  
- Neurodivergent learners and law enforcement benefit from the straightforward design.  
- Schools and community groups use the tool to teach blockchain concepts visually.  
## Networks and future plans  
- The explorer works across Ethereum, Solana, XRPL and Arbitrum.  
- Support for Bitcoin and other chains is on the roadmap.  
- A custom API and graphing library will let developers build on top of Hindsight.  
- Machine learning will sort smart contracts into categories automatically.
